# -Creating-a-sales-dashboard-and-obtaining-key-insights.

In this project I have created a dashboard from the data which captures useful insights from the data and gives a crisp summary for the business.

*Insights*

**Sales Trend:** Displays the sales trend over time, allowing users to explore how sales have evolved over different periods.

**Country-wise Sales by Segments:** Shows the sales data segmented by different product categories for each country. This will help identify which segments are performing well in specific regions.

**Shipping Modes Proportion:** Illustrates the proportion of different shipping modes used for the sales, giving an overview of how products are being delivered to customers.

**Profit Analysis:** Analyzes the profit generated by different product segments and categories, enabling users to compare profitability across various areas of the business.

*Description of the files*

**Sales Dashboard Visualisation:** The pdf file has the final dashboard visualisation of the project.

**Creating Dashboard from Sales dataset:** The Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xlsx) has the raw data with the charts and the dashboard in three different sheets.
